Day 2 - Web Development Learning
- Learned about HTML heading tags (<h1> to <h6>) and their semantic importance. 
  -> Headings help define structure and are prioritized by search engines over regular text.
- Explored lists in HTML:
  -> Ordered List (<ol>)
  -> Unordered List (<ul>)
  -> Definition List (<dl>)
- Practiced using anchor tags (<a>) for hyperlinks.
  -> By default, links open in the same tab.
  -> To open in a new tab, use the attribute: target="_blank".
